# Learning DSA in Java

This repository contains a collection of Java programs and exercises focused on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.
It is organized into multiple folders, each covering a specific concept or problem-solving approach in DSA using Java.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **Animal/** → Example classes demonstrating object-oriented concepts.
- **ArraysExample/** → Programs covering arrays, searching, and basic operations.
- **BinarySearch/** → Implementation of binary search algorithm.
- **LinkedLists/** → Examples of singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Queues/** → Queue implementations and operations.
- **Stacks/** → Stack implementations and applications.
- **Sorting/** → Sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, etc.
- **Recursion/** → Programs solving problems using recursion.
- **Trees/** → Tree data structure implementations and traversals.
- **Graphs/** → Graph representations and algorithms.
- **Hashing/** → Examples of hashing and hash-based data structures.
- **PracticeProblems/** → Miscellaneous DSA problems for practice.

## 📖 Description

This repository is intended as a **learning resource for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms in Java**.
It is structured into multiple small projects, each focusing on one concept, making it easier to learn step by step.

## 📝 Detailed Description

The repository contains practical Java implementations of core DSA concepts:

- Foundational structures: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues.
- Algorithmic techniques: Recursion, Searching, Sorting.
